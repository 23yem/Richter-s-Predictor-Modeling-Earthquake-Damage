    "1. **Correlation Matrix with Heatmap**: Correlation states how the features are related to each other or the target variable. You can use a heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix.\n",

The scikit-learn library provides the `SelectKBest` class that can be used with a suite of different statistical tests to select a specific number of features.\n",
    "\n",

    "4. **Feature Importance**: You can get the feature importance of each feature of your dataset by using the feature importance property of the model. For example, Decision Trees models in the scikit-learn library offer an importance property that can be accessed directly.\n",
